","The withdrawal of water from the Colorado River with its highly turbid and variable flows presented several unique problems.  The raw water intake design incorporating an Armco binwall as a pier that has worked very effectively with minimal maintenance. ","The raw water pump station uses submersible, open impeller pumps that have the ability to handle abrasive, highly turbid raw water under variable flow conditions.  Since the project’s completion, these pumps have had very minimal maintenance and have never been replaced."],"image":null,"slug":{"current":"town-of-debeque-river-intake-and-raw-water-pump-station"},"gallery":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"town-of-debeque-river-intake-and-raw-water-pump-station","project":"Town of DeBeque – River Intake and Raw Water Pump Station","booleanValue":"/true"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
