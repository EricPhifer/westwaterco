","This included widening the diversion structure from 60-feet to 100-feet after denaturing the site and excavating to bedrock.  The structure was reinforced through the addition of new walls and erosion pads.  Additional features in the design included a new intake screen, silt flushing pipe  and slide gates. ","The intake was designed to minimize the problems with silt build-up and ice encrustation and included a small settling basin with a drain pipe to allow flushing.  Water is then diverted down a raw water pipeline to the Town’s water treatment plant.  The new diversion/intake structure now safely passes the 100-year flood and was designed to prevent undercutting and erosion of the relatively soft bedrock in the stream."],"image":null,"slug":{"current":"town-of-naturita-raw-water-intake-and-diversion-structure"},"gallery":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"town-of-naturita-raw-water-intake-and-diversion-structure","project":"Town of Naturita – Raw Water Intake and Diversion Structure","booleanValue":"/true"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
