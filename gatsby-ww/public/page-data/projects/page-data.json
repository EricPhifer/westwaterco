WestWater biologists completed the raptor surveys in accordance with BLM, Grand Junction Field Office, and Grand Mesa National Forest survey protocols for raptors using call playback methodology.","Surveys were also completed for sensitive, threatened and endangered plant species. WestWater prepared a biological survey report upon the completion of field surveys that was used in BLM’s NEPA analysis of the project.
