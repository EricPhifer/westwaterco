","New treatment equipment included pressure cartridge filtration units and state-of-the-art chlorine gas flow meters and automatic controls for varying influent rate of flows. ","WestWater Engineering also assisted the District with a design of add-on second-stage, final filtration units in order to comply with filtration treatment requirements. ","The design also incorporated an additional raw water booster pump that would be activated once the combined differential pressure across both stages of filtration reaches limits of existing pump capabilities, in order to fully experience the maximum allowed differential pressure and to extend the useful service life of disposable filter cartridges."],"image":null,"slug":{"current":"mesa-water-and-sanitation-district-project-2"},"gallery":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"mesa-water-and-sanitation-district-project-2","project":"Mesa Water & Sanitation District – Project 2","booleanValue":"/true"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
