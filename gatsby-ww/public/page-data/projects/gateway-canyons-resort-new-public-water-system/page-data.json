Water treatment is limited to disinfection, and also includes passive aeration at the storage tank inlet to remove dissolved radon in the water supply. ","The water system currently includes two (2) separate water well supplies and liquid hypochlorite disinfection systems, a below ground cast-in-place three-compartment concrete water storage tank, and a gravity flow distribution system network.  ","A master plan for water system expansion and service to remote areas of existing and potential development was developed using NET900 computer modeling, and includes a booster pump station and additional storage facilities and distribution system above the current pressure zone, with PRV vault between the upper and lower (existing) pressure zones."],"image":null,"slug":{"current":"gateway-canyons-resort-new-public-water-system"},"gallery":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"gateway-canyons-resort-new-public-water-system","project":"Gateway Canyons Resort – New Public Water System","booleanValue":"/true"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
