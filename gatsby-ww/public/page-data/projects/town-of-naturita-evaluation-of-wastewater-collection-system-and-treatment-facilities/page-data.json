","The evaluation of the treatment facility has included installation of our continuous flow recorder at the influent of the plant to determine the extent of infiltration/inflow in the system. ","Based upon the final conclusions and recommendations of the report, the Town had to implement a capital improvement plan to either upgrade the treatment facility and request an 85% removal waiver from the Colorado Department of Health to treat the infiltration or eliminate the infiltration through collection system repairs and replacements based upon the most cost-effective alternative for the Town."],"image":null,"slug":{"current":"town-of-naturita-evaluation-of-wastewater-collection-system-and-treatment-facilities"},"gallery":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"town-of-naturita-evaluation-of-wastewater-collection-system-and-treatment-facilities","project":"Town of Naturita – Evaluation of Wastewater Collection System and Treatment Facilities","booleanValue":"/true"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
