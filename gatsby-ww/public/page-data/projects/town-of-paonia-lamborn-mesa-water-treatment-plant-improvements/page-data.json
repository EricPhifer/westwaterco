","Reclassification of the Lamborn Mesa water treatment plant required upgrades to the filtration system, similar to improvements previously implemented at the lower Clock water treatment Plant. ","WestWater Engineering assisted the Town by negotiating an extended timeline to implement improvements to develop a Preliminary Engineering Report that was necessary for long-range planning and funding applications. ","The upper water treatment plant improvement project consisted of procurement of a new membrane filtration water treatment system and a building addition for the new filtration equipment including conversion from gaseous chlorine disinfection to liquid hypochlorite, process piping throughout the new and existing treatment plant building, incremental decommissioning of former unit treatment processes, and site utility upgrades."],"image":null,"slug":{"current":"town-of-paonia-lamborn-mesa-water-treatment-plant-improvements"},"gallery":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"town-of-paonia-lamborn-mesa-water-treatment-plant-improvements","project":"Town of Paonia – Lamborn Mesa Water Treatment Plant Improvements","booleanValue":"/true"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
