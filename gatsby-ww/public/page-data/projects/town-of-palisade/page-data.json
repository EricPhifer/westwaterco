The study was completed in part to determine the impacts on the Town’s water system of the proposed high school. ","A hydraulic model of the Town’s system was completed to determine the most optimum pipe sizes for the proposed distribution system in the west Palisade area, based upon different population scenarios, and zoning requirements. ","The master plan was developed not only to ensure that required flows be provided to the high school, but that as development occurred in the west Palisade area, any new water main improvements would be adequately sized.  After determining the appropriate growth and zoning scenario, the Town adopted the utility master plan which was used for sizing of the waterline extension to Palisade High School."],"image":null,"slug":{"current":"town-of-palisade"},"gallery":null}},"pageContext":{"slug":"town-of-palisade","project":"Town of Palisade","booleanValue":"/true"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
