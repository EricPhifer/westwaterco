","The study reviewed the capacity of all unit processes in the system, evaluated water quality data, predicted future loadings, reviewed the pretreatment and disinfection systems and provided recommendations for upgrades.  The recommended process was a high-rate aerated lagoon system which would be followed by conversion to the activated sludge process when influent flows were adequate to support that process. ","Since then, the most recent oil and gas boom in the area has required the District to reactivate the activated sludge facility at a reduced capacity of 0.75 MGD."],"image":{"hotspot":null,"crop":null,"asset":{"_id":"image-5abe13ffc1abb095ab2891c55e841b5e9a3eb774-3296x2472-jpg","metadata":{"preview":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAPABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUEBgf/xAAlEAABAwMCBgMAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIDBAURBiESExQiMVFCYXH/xAAWAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADAQL/xAAYEQEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABESUf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AvlFf7hQFor7pPLMW5DOIbfZWaa21DLcK2Tq3Euz59pVSXqaqL5XuPNcMndLL4908bZfk0YP4gy3bGEqLZZIHSEmIk+8oUB57tiha09kyT//Z"}}},"slug":{"current":"battlement-mesa-metropolitan-district-evaluation-of-wastewater-treatment-plant"},"gallery":{"images":[{"hotspot":null,"crop":null,"asset":{"_id":"image-5abe13ffc1abb095ab2891c55e841b5e9a3eb774-3296x2472-jpg","metadata":{"preview":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAPABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGAAAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUEBgf/xAAlEAABAwMCBgMAAAAAAAAAAAABAAIDBAURBiESExQiMVFCYXH/xAAWAQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADAQL/xAAYEQEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABESUf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AvlFf7hQFor7pPLMW5DOIbfZWaa21DLcK2Tq3Euz59pVSXqaqL5XuPNcMndLL4908bZfk0YP4gy3bGEqLZZIHSEmIk+8oUB57tiha09kyT//Z"}}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"battlement-mesa-metropolitan-district-evaluation-of-wastewater-treatment-plant"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
